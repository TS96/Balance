# About 
Balance is a physics puzzle simulator whose purpose is to demonstrate basic pinciples of phyysics. The game is divded into short levels, each with a specific concept to demonstrate to the player. Before and during each level, the user is presented with information on the concept that he/she is learning in that level and the user can apply that concept in the game. By the end of the game, the user would have gained knowledge of many physics concepts and hopefully had fun doing so.
